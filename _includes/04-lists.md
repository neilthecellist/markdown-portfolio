Take this base scenario-based question:

* **Base Scenario**: You want to explore machine learning, and your organization is new to machine learning altogether. Your organization has some AWS footprint. You explore SageMaker, which is AWS' machine learning product/service. You do some testing, push from DEV to QA, then realize something doesn't work, so you shut down the project. **What happens to the engineer?**

  * **Outcome A**:  Your boss/other stakeholders in company grill you for wasting the company's time and money. You are written up, your coworkers snicker during breaks and lunches about your failure. At the worst of companies, you are written up. So it goes on "record" of your "failure".

  * **Outcome B**: Your boss/other stakeholders get together, ask what learning value can be learned from this project being cut short, and as a team, you use that experience to either re-evaluate SageMaker from a different standpoint, or taking up a different approach to machine learning (such as setting up your own servers on Amazon EC2 and building your own machine learning solution, aka "self-hosting").

Outcome B pushes towards a *solution*. Outcome A focuses on *blame* under the mask of "accountability".

* The "blame" concept falls under the Westrum culture model as "pathological".
* The "blameless" concept falls under the Westrum culture model as "generative".
* The adherence to the familiar in IT is known as modal-1 IT in Gartner terms.
* The explorative curiosity in IT is known as modal-2 IT in Gartner terms.

B is the better outcome, and if the employer starts talking about things that align more with outcome A, that's your cue to run.
